            Hej hej fra KÃ¸benhavn! I'm Anastasios Tatarakis, a software
            developer based in Copenhagen. I work on full-stack projects while
            studying Computer Science at the University of London.
          </p>
          <p>
            My background includes developing healthcare systems and workflow
            tools. I've managed IT infrastructure at a dental clinic and built
            an inventory system to track supplies. During my internship at
            NordInsight, I worked with React, Node.js, and MongoDB.
          </p>
          <p>
            My finance background helps me understand how technology can address
            business needs. I run a blog called The Digital Shift where I break
            down complex tech and finance topics into plain language.
          </p>
          <p>
            Outside of work, I enjoy 3D printing, basketball, and 90s hip hop.
            I'm currently working at Soho House while completing my studies.
          </p>
          <p>
            I'm good at organizing teams and projects, and I can be strict about
            keeping things on track. Looking back at my work history, I've led
            and inspired many people. I listen well but have little patience for
            constant complainers. If you're looking for help with any project in
            the Nordics, where you think I would be usefull, then let's connect.
