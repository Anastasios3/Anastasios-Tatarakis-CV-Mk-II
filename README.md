2. **Install Dependencies**

   Install Sass globally if it's not already installed:

4. **Run a Local Server**

   Use a local server to view the project. One simple method is to use the [Live Server extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) in Visual Studio Code, or use a lightweight local server like `http-server`.

   If using `http-server`, install it globally:

   ```bash
   npm install -g http-server
   ```

   Then run it in the project directory:

   ```bash
