## About Me

My name is Anastasios Tatarakis, a dedicated Web Developer with a robust foundation in Laravel and WordPress. I specialize in developing web applications and websites, notably for the healthcare sector. My technical journey is fortified by an IBM Full Stack Software Developer Professional Certificate, alongside continuous skill enhancements through targeted seminars.

I am deeply passionate about leveraging my technical expertise in dynamic environments, contributing to innovative projects that push the boundaries of web development and graphic design. With hands-on experience in 3D modeling using Rhinoceros with Python/Rhinoscript, I bring a unique blend of creativity and technical prowess to the table.

Currently, I am expanding my horizons by pursuing further education as a Software Technician, focusing on Software/Web Design-Development and Video Games, at the Public Vocational Institute in Rethymno, Crete. Alongside my professional endeavors, I engage in freelance projects, offering graphic design services for local businesses, enhancing their branding with my adept use of Inkscape, Adobe Illustrator, and Premier.
